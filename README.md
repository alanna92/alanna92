### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I really love web programming, but I feel comfortable doing different things too, like desktop applications. The main goal is to solve problems and see things working.

I'm a FullStack Developer, but I'm trying to focus on Frontend.

I'm working at **Itaipu Technological Park**
<br/> :heart: &nbsp; Developing systems for the electrical sector. My activities cover from requirement analysis to tests and validation with clients.
<br/> :computer: &nbsp; I'm currently working with Spring Boot and Angular 8, but also learning NodeJS, Elixir, ReactJS and ReactNative.
